# Run AxonASP-FPM for Isolated FastCGI Pools

## Overview

**G3Pix AxonASP-FPM** is the managed FastCGI process manager for multi-application deployments.
It supervises independent `axonasp-fastcgi` worker processes, applies per-pool execution identities, and restarts failed workers automatically.

Use this mode when you host multiple applications, shared hosting tenants, or any environment where one application must not affect the others.

## Requirements

- **Operating system:** Linux or macOS.
- **Privileges:** Start `axonasp-fpm` as **root**.
- **Pool files directory:** `/opt/axonasp/fpm/fpm.d/`.
- **FastCGI worker binary path:** `/opt/axonasp/axonasp-fastcgi`.

`axonasp-fpm` must start as root so it can:

- Spawn workers with per-pool UID and GID.
- Create and own socket and temp directories.
- Apply process memory controls where the operating system supports them.
- Enforce pool isolation boundaries.

## Architecture and Worker Lifecycle

`axonasp-fpm` uses a manager-plus-workers model:

1. The manager scans `/opt/axonasp/fpm/fpm.d/` for `*.conf` files.
2. For each new pool file, it starts one supervisor goroutine.
3. The supervisor validates the pool, prepares directories, and starts `axonasp-fastcgi`.
4. The manager drops worker privileges to the configured `uid` and `gid`.
5. If a worker exits unexpectedly, the supervisor restarts it after a 2-second delay.
6. Restart attempts stop when `max_restarts` is reached (unless the value is `0`).

Signal behavior:

- `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`: Stop all pools and shut down the manager and the fastcgi workers.
- `SIGUSR2` (systemd `reload` action): Rescan pool directory and start supervisors for **new** `.conf` files (alternative to `SIGHUP`).

Important operational detail:

- A `SIGUSR2` (systemd `reload` action) rescan does not reload or stop already active pools. It only adds missing supervisors for newly detected files. In these cases, you must stop and restart the manager to reload pool configuration changes.

## Pool Configuration Directives

Each pool file in `/opt/axonasp/fpm/fpm.d/` is a TOML document.

| Directive | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `site_name` | Yes | String | Pool identifier used in manager logs and cgroup naming. Use a unique value per application. |
| `uid` | Yes | Integer | Numeric user ID used to run the worker process. |
| `gid` | Yes | Integer | Numeric group ID used to run the worker process. |
| `socket` | Yes | String | FastCGI endpoint passed to `--fastcgi.server_port`. Supports Unix socket paths or TCP endpoints. |
| `config_file` | Yes | String | Absolute path to the AxonASP TOML config file used by the worker (`--config.config_file`). |
| `app_path` | Yes | String | Worker current directory. Must be an existing directory. |
| `memory_limit_mb` | Yes | Integer | Memory ceiling in MB. The manager exports memory-related environment variables and attempts cgroup enforcement. |
| `max_restarts` | Yes | Integer | Maximum restart attempts after crashes. Use `0` for unlimited restarts. |
| `tmp_dir` | No | String | Temporary directory for the pool. Defaults to `/opt/axonasp/temp/` when omitted. |

## Supported Socket Values

`socket` accepts these endpoint styles:

- Unix socket with prefix: `unix:/var/run/axonasp/example.sock`
- TCP host and port: `127.0.0.1:9100`
- TCP port only: `9000`

If you use a Unix socket, the manager creates the parent directory, changes ownership to the pool UID and GID, and removes stale socket files before worker start.

## Complete Pool Example

You can use this as a production baseline and adjust values for each application or use the example file in `/opt/axonasp/fpm/fpm.d/example.conf` as a template:

```toml
site_name = "example.com"
uid = 1001
gid = 1001
socket = "/var/run/axonasp/example.com.sock"
config_file = "/opt/axonasp/config/axonasp.toml"
app_path = "/opt/axonasp/"
memory_limit_mb = 256
max_restarts = 5
tmp_dir = "/opt/axonasp/temp/"
```

## Permissions and Isolation Checklist

Before you start `axonasp-fpm`, ensure the configured `uid` and `gid` have:

- **Read access** to `config_file`.
- **Read and execute access** to `app_path` and application files.
- **Write access** to `tmp_dir`.
- **Write access** to the Unix socket directory when using a Unix socket.

If permissions are incorrect, the pool fails to start or restarts repeatedly.

## Start and Operate the Manager

Example startup:

```bash
sudo /opt/axonasp/axonasp-fpm
```

For production, run `axonasp-fpm` as a **systemd service** instead of a manual shell process.

### Create a systemd Service (Recommended)

Create `/etc/systemd/system/axonasp-fpm.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=AxonASP-FPM
After=network.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Group=root
ExecStart=/opt/axonasp/axonasp-fpm
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=2
KillSignal=SIGTERM
TimeoutStopSec=30
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
SyslogIdentifier=axonasp-fpm

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable axonasp-fpm
sudo systemctl start axonasp-fpm
```

Check status and logs:

```bash
sudo systemctl status axonasp-fpm
sudo journalctl -u axonasp-fpm -f
```

Common operations:

```bash
# Direct process mode: add new pool file, then trigger rescan
sudo kill -HUP <fpm_manager_pid>

# Direct process mode: graceful stop
sudo kill -TERM <fpm_manager_pid>

# systemd mode: graceful stop/start, full restart and reload
sudo systemctl stop axonasp-fpm
sudo systemctl start axonasp-fpm
sudo systemctl restart axonasp-fpm
sudo systemctl reload axonasp-fpm #Only adds new file supervisors without affecting active pools.

```

## Memory Control Notes

For each worker, the manager exports:

- `GOMEMLIMIT=<memory_limit_mb>MiB`
- `GLOBAL_GOLANG_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB=<memory_limit_mb>MiB`
- `GLOBAL_TEMP_DIR=<tmp_dir>`
- `TMPDIR=<tmp_dir>`

On Linux, the manager also attempts cgroup v2 memory enforcement under:

`/sys/fs/cgroup/axonasp/<site_name>`

If cgroup delegation or permissions are missing, the manager logs a warning and continues running the pool.

## Standalone vs FPM Boundaries

Do not mix unmanaged standalone workers and managed pools for the same application endpoint.

- Do not start `axonasp-fastcgi` manually on a socket or port that an FPM pool already owns.
- Do not manage crash recovery scripts for workers already supervised by FPM.
- Do not share one Unix socket path across multiple pools.

Use standalone FastCGI only for single-application or explicitly manual deployments.
Use AxonASP-FPM as the default production model for multi-application hosting and when you need to use more than one global.asa context.
