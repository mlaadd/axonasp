# Use JavaScript (JScript) in AxonASP Pages

## Overview
AxonASP provides a high-performance JavaScript (JScript) execution engine that allows you to write server-side logic using full ECMAScript 5 (ES5) standards for JScript compatibility and also ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and onward features for new code. This page covers how to enable JavaScript (JScript), use ASP intrinsic objects, and leverage modern JavaScript features within your ASP applications.

### Why use JavaScript (JScript) in ASP?
- **Familiar Syntax**: Many developers are more familiar with JavaScript than VBScript, making it easier to write complex logic. This allows the user to write full HTML pages, and services using javascript only, with the full support of the AxonASP framework, and in a way that is easier and more memory efficient than using systems like NodeJS.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Access to a wide range of JavaScript libraries and tools.
- **Performance**: The AxonASP JavaScript engine is optimized for server-side execution, providing better performance for certain workloads.
- **ASP Intrinsic Objects**: Seamless access to ASP intrinsic objects like `Request`, `Response`, `Session`, and `Application` allows you to build dynamic web applications with ease.
- **Modern Features**: Support for ES5 and most of ES6 features allows you to write cleaner and more efficient code.

## Syntax
To set JavaScript (JScript) as the default language for an entire page, use the language directive at the very first line of your file:

```asp
<%@ Language="javascript" %>
```

or

```asp
<%@ Language="jscript" %>
```

Alternatively, you can use JavaScript (JScript) within specific script blocks:

```html
<script runat="server" language="javascript">
    // JavaScript (JScript) code here
</script>
```

## Parameters and Arguments
- **Language Directive** (Required for page-level): The value must be `"JavaScript (JScript)"` or `"Javascript"`.
- **runat="server"** (Required for script tags): Ensures the code executes on the server rather than the client browser.
- **ASP Intrinsic Objects**: Native access to **Request**, **Response**, **Server**, **Session**, **Application**, and **Err**. Note that in JavaScript (JScript), these object names and their members are **case-sensitive**.

## Return Values
The JavaScript (JScript) engine returns standard JavaScript values (String, Number, Boolean, Object, Array, null, undefined). When communicating with the AxonASP VM or VBScript components:
- JavaScript objects are automatically converted to their closest AxonASP **Value** equivalent.
- **undefined** and **null** map to **Empty** in the VM context.

## Remarks
- **ECMAScript 5/6 Support**: AxonASP's JavaScript (JScript) engine supports all ES5 features, including JSON support (`JSON.parse`, `JSON.stringify`), and standard Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`). Most features from ES 6 and later are also supported, but refer to the documentation for specific details.
- **Case Sensitivity**: Unlike VBScript, JavaScript (JScript) is strictly case-sensitive. You must use `Response.Write`, not `response.write`.
- **Engine Architecture**: JavaScript (JScript) execution in AxonASP utilizes a sophisticated Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser and interpreter, providing optimized performance for complex logic.
- **Global Console**: The engine includes a built-in **console** object (`console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`) for server-side debugging and diagnostics. Output is directed to the system console or log files depending on your `axonasp.toml` configuration.
- **Interoperability**: You can mix VBScript and JavaScript (JScript) in the same application by using separate `<script runat="server">` blocks, though global variable sharing follows standard ASP scoping rules.

## Code Example
The following example demonstrates using ES5 features and ASP objects within a JavaScript (JScript) page:

```asp
<%@ Language="javascript" %>
<%

// Using ES5 Array methods
var data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var doubled = data.map(function(n) {
    return n * 2;
});

// Using the JSON object
var responseData = {
    status: "success",
    processed: doubled,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
};

Response.ContentType = "application/json";
Response.Write(JSON.stringify(responseData));

// Server-side logging
console.log("JSON response sent for timestamp: " + responseData.timestamp);
%>
```
