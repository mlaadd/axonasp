Welcome to **AxonASP 2.1**, the definitive, high-performance runtime for executing Microsoft Classic ASP and VBScript in GoLang. We didn't just update the engine; we completely reinvented it. 

> [!NOTE]
> **⚠️ Important Notice:** _AxonASP Version 1.0_ is completely **deprecated** and is not compatible with Version 2.0 or later. 
> The architectural leaps we've made mean a clean break from the past to deliver the future of ASP.

If you thought Classic ASP was dead, think again. AxonASP breathes raw power, modern infrastructure compatibility, and incredible new features into the language you know and love. It's time to realize the true potential of your applications!

## 🔥 Why AxonASP? The Performance Revolution

We threw out the rulebook to achieve extreme performance improvements that will blow your mind:

*   **Zero AST, Pure Bytecode:** The new VBScript compiler is single-pass and emits bytecode directly to a highly optimized, stack-based Virtual Machine. By eliminating the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), AxonASP executes scripts with virtually zero-allocation overhead. It is insanely fast and memory optimized.
*   **IIS-Style VM Pooling & Advanced Caching:** We've implemented an advanced VM pool modeled perfectly after IIS, combined with aggressive script caching and `eval`/`execute`/`executeglobal` compilation caching. Processing times are phenomenally accelerated and better than the Windows Server ASP engine in most cases.
*   **Standardization meets Innovation:** You get 99% adherence to Classic ASP and VBScript standards, meaning your legacy code drops right in. But we didn't stop there: we added over **60 custom Axon functions**, including advanced array manipulation, to make writing ASP a joy again, and full support to JavaScript code, that you can even mix with VBScript seamlessly.
*   **Run ASP Anywhere:** Web server, FastCGI, or the command line! The brand new **CLI with TUI (Text User Interface)** allows you to execute ASP code directly from your terminal. This opens incredible possibilities: run scheduled ASP scripts as background jobs, cron tasks, and powerful system administration tools!
*   **AI-Ready with MCP:** AxonASP includes a built-in Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. AI agents can now connect directly to your runtime, understand your specific environment, and autonomously author complete ASP pages utilizing all available native functions.
*   **Test-Driven ASP:** Say goodbye to broken scripts and regressions. The new `axonasp-testsuite` executable allows you to write and run automated test suites directly against your ASP files natively!
*   **High-Performance JScript (ES5):** AxonASP now includes a dedicated, AST-based JScript engine, derived from Goja. Mostly compliant with ECMAScript 5, it supports JavaScript features like `JSON`, `Array.map/filter`, and strict mode, allowing you to modernize your logic while keeping the ASP infrastructure.

## 🛠️ What's New in Version 2.x?

*   **Smarter Networking:** The default proxy server port has been changed (now 8801) to intelligently avoid common firewall errors and system port conflicts right out of the box.
*   **Centralized Configuration:** Say hello to `Viper`. Manage your entire server environment from a single, unified `axonasp.toml` configuration file, with simultaneous, drop-in support for `.env` environment variables.
*   **Complete Local Documentation:** Stop endlessly searching the web for old forums. The complete, extensive manual is available right inside the repository at `./www/manual/md/`.
*   **Access Database Converter:** Migrating away from legacy Windows servers? Use the built-in tool at `/www/database-convert/` (Windows only) to easily convert your legacy Access databases to modern formats.
*   **Modern Architecture Templates:** Who says ASP can't be modern? We include complete, working examples for **REST, RESTful, MVC, and MVVM** architectures built purely in high-performance ASP.
*   **Native Docker Support:** Containerize your legacy apps in seconds. Full, production-ready support is provided via the included `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.
*   **Extended Functionality**: 60+ custom functions inspired by PHP for enhanced productivity
*   **Database Support**: SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle, Microsoft Access (Windows)

## 🎨 AxonLive with Visual Application Builder

**AxonLive**  is a high-performance Reactive Component Framework built directly into the AxonASP Virtual Machine. It empowers developers to create dynamic, stateful, and highly responsive web applications using Classic ASP (VBScript or Server-Side JavaScript) without requiring full page reloads.

### Advantages of G3AxonLive

* **Zero Page Reloads:** All UI interactions (button clicks, form submissions, timers) are sent to the server asynchronously. The server responds with targeted JSON patches, swapping only the modified DOM elements.
* **Strict Backend Control:** All business logic, validation, and state mutation happen exclusively on the server. The client browser merely acts as a dumb terminal rendering the HTML patches, significantly reducing the attack surface.
* **Authenticated Session Binding:** The /g3al endpoint binds every async event to the authenticated ASPSESSIONID cookie. Client-provided session identifiers are not used as an authority for page routing.
* **Zero Additional Wrappers:** AxonLive is implemented directly inside the axonvm engine as a native procedural controller (G3AXONLIVE). This eliminates the need for bulky ASP class wrappers, providing bare-metal performance and zero garbage collection overhead.
* **Granular DOM Manipulation:** Instead of re-rendering entire components, developers can push targeted instructions to modify styles, attributes, classes, or trigger external redirects natively from ASP.

### Getting Started with AxonLive

You can use **AxonLive Builder** that is available directly in the `www/` directory of your AxonASP installation to implement the reactive components in your ASP applications. The builder provides a simple interface to create and manage your reactive components, allowing you to focus on building your application logic without worrying about the underlying implementation details.:

## 🚀 Quick Deployment & Execution

AxonASP is designed to be built and deployed in seconds, getting your applications online faster than ever.

### Prerequisites
*   GoLang 1.26+ (to build the system binaries if not using the packaged releases)
*   Your existing ASP codebase (or explore our awesome examples in `/www/`)

### Building the Engine
We provide robust, ready-to-use build scripts right in the root directory. You can build for Windows, Linux, or macOS with a single command. The scripts also support passing Go compilation tags to disable specific libraries for leaner binaries.

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\build.ps1 -Platform "windows" -Architecture "amd64"
```

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
./build.sh --platform "linux" --architecture "amd64"
```

### Build with selected libraries only
Use the build scripts to disable specific libraries. This is useful for leaner binaries or constrained environments. Use lib_<name>_disabled as the tag format. For example, to disable G3CRYPTO and G3HTTP, use lib_g3crypto_disabled and lib_g3http_disabled.

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
./build.ps1 -Tags "lib_adodb_disabled lib_msxml_disabled"
./build.ps1 -Tags "lib_g3image_disabled,lib_g3pdf_disabled"
```

**Linux / macOS (Bash):**
```bash
./build.sh --tags "lib_adodb_disabled lib_msxml_disabled"
./build.sh --tags "lib_g3image_disabled,lib_g3pdf_disabled"
```

You can separate tags with spaces, commas, or semicolons in both scripts.

For the complete list of supported disable tags and usage guidance, see the manual page at `www/manual/md/runtime/compilation-library-disable-tags.md`.

### Deployment Architectures: Proxy vs. FastCGI

AxonASP provides total flexibility in how you expose your applications to the world. You have two primary architectural choices:

1.  **Reverse Proxy Mode (`axonasp-http`):** Run AxonASP's built-in web server and place a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) in front of it. The proxy handles TLS/SSL termination, caching static files, and security, while simply forwarding dynamic ASP requests to AxonASP.
2.  **FastCGI Mode (`axonasp-fastcgi`):** Integrate directly with your web server using the FastCGI protocol. This bypasses HTTP overhead between the proxy and the application, providing native integration.

*(Note: Both modes offer the exact same feature parity, except the web.config support which is only available in Reverse Proxy Mode. Choose the one that best fits your infrastructure needs.)*

### Nginx Deployment Examples

**Option A: Using Nginx as a Reverse Proxy**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name myapp.local;

    # Serve static files directly via Nginx for max speed
    location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|css|js)$ {
        root /var/www/axonasp/www;
    }

    # Forward ASP and other dynamic requests to AxonASP HTTP Server
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8801;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

**Option B: Using Nginx with FastCGI**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name myapp.local;
    root /var/www/axonasp/www;

    # Pass ASP files directly to the AxonASP FastCGI daemon
    location ~ \.asp$ {
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }
}
```

### Apache Deployment Examples

**Option A: Using Apache as a Reverse Proxy**
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName myapp.local
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/axonasp/www"

    # Serve static assets locally to reduce load
    ProxyPassMatch "^/(.*\.jpg|png|css|js)$" "!"

    # Forward everything else to AxonASP HTTP Server
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8801/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8801/
</VirtualHost>
```

**Option B: Using Apache with FastCGI (Requires mod_proxy_fcgi)**
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName myapp.local
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/axonasp/www"

    # Pass ASP requests to the AxonASP FastCGI daemon
    <FilesMatch "\.asp$">
        SetHandler "proxy:fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000"
    </FilesMatch>
</VirtualHost>
```

## 🧪 Experimental: WASM (WebAssembly) Support

AxonASP now includes a **experimental support for WebAssembly**, allowing you to:

*   **Run ASP on the Browser:** Compile and execute ASP/VBScript/JavaScript code directly in the browser using WebAssembly, enabling new use cases like offline-capable web applications and edge computing.
*   **Hybrid Execution:** Seamlessly mix client-side ASP (via WASM) and server-side execution for optimal performance and user experience.
*   **Portable Bytecode:** Distribute compiled ASP bytecode to clients, reducing server load and enabling true distributed computing scenarios.
*   **Performance:** Leverage native WASM performance (near-native speeds) for computationally intensive operations on the client side.

### Using WASM

WASM support is currently in active development. The implementation is located in the `wasm/` directory. To explore and experiment with WASM capabilities:

1. Review the documentation and examples in `wasm/`, as some features of AxonASP are not yet supported in WASM mode
2. Compile ASP to WebAssembly using the provided build tools
3. Integrate the generated WASM modules into your web applications
4. Test and provide feedback on the experimental features

> **⚠️ Important:** WASM support is experimental and subject to change. It is not yet recommended for production environments. We welcome testing and feedback from the community!
