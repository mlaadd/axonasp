Welcome to **AxonASP 2.2**, the definitive high-performance runtime for executing Microsoft Classic ASP, VBScript, and JavaScript in GoLang. If you are looking for how to run Classic ASP on Linux or modernize legacy applications within a Docker container, AxonASP provides a robust, zero-allocation VM architecture tailored for modern infrastructure.

## 🚀 Why AxonASP?

AxonASP is built from the ground up for speed, low memory usage, and containerized deployments.

* **Run Classic ASP on Linux & Cross-Platform:** Say goodbye to IIS dependencies. AxonASP runs natively on Windows, Linux, and macOS, either as a standalone web server, via FastCGI, or directly from the CLI.
* **Modern JavaScript (ES6+) Implementation:** We support fully compliant ECMAScript 6+ alongside VBScript. Unlike Node.js, AxonASP executes JavaScript directly through our AST-based engine without forcing a Promise-based paradigm for everything.
  * **Memory Efficiency:** A pure JavaScript API running on AxonASP uses only **18MB in idle mode** (compared to 30MB for Node.js). During execution, parsing and serving JSON takes just **30MB** versus 50MB in Node.js.
  * **Partial Node.js Module Compatibility:** Easily organize and import JavaScript code using CommonJS/ES6 module syntax directly in your ASP environment.
* **High Performance & Active Caching:** AxonASP is heavily optimized to run ASP pages and components swiftly with minimal CPU and memory footprints. With our active caching architecture, **2000 requests per minute** on simple pages consume only about **100MB of memory**.
* **Zero AST for VBScript:** Our VBScript compiler is single-pass, emitting bytecode directly to a stack-based VM to achieve extreme processing speeds.
* **AI-Ready:** Includes a built-in Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, allowing AI agents to connect directly to the runtime, analyze your environment, and autonomously author ASP pages.

## ⚡ Built-in G3 Libraries

AxonASP extends standard ASP with native Go libraries, giving you enterprise power with zero overhead:
- **G3JSON, G3DB, G3HTTP:** Effortlessly handle JSON, connect to databases (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, Oracle), and fetch external APIs.
- **G3CRYPTO, G3MAIL, G3IMAGE:** Generate secure hashes, send SMTP emails, and process images on the fly.
- **G3ZIP, G3TAR, G3ZLIB, G3ZSTD:** Full compression suite built right in.
- **And much more...** Over 60 custom Axon functions are available to extend ASP's capabilities.

For a full list of libraries and documentation on how to use them, please read our extensive manual at [`./www/manual/`](www/manual/) and explore our website at [https://g3pix.com.br/axonasp](https://g3pix.com.br/axonasp), where you will find pages running in AxonASP 2.2 and also our WASM Playground.

## 🎨 AxonLive with Visual Application Builder

**AxonLive** is a high-performance Reactive Component Framework built directly into the AxonASP Virtual Machine. It empowers developers to create dynamic, stateful, and highly responsive web applications using Classic ASP (VBScript or Server-Side JavaScript) without requiring full page reloads.

### Advantages of G3AxonLive

* **Zero Page Reloads:** All UI interactions (button clicks, form submissions, timers) are sent to the server asynchronously. The server responds with targeted JSON patches, swapping only the modified DOM elements.
* **Strict Backend Control:** All business logic, validation, and state mutation happen exclusively on the server. The client browser merely acts as a dumb terminal rendering the HTML patches, significantly reducing the attack surface.
* **Authenticated Session Binding:** The `/g3al` endpoint binds every async event to the authenticated `ASPSESSIONID` cookie. Client-provided session identifiers are not used as an authority for page routing.
* **Zero Additional Wrappers:** AxonLive is implemented directly inside the `axonvm` engine as a native procedural controller (`G3AXONLIVE`), providing bare-metal performance and zero garbage collection overhead.
* **Granular DOM Manipulation:** Push targeted instructions to modify styles, attributes, classes, or trigger external redirects natively from ASP.
* **WASM + AxonLive:** Run performance-critical VBScript directly in the browser using AxonASP WebAssembly, opening incredible possibilities for offline-capable web applications.

You can use the **AxonLive Builder** available in the `www/axonlive/builder/` directory to seamlessly create and manage reactive components.

## 🚀 Quick Deployment & Execution

AxonASP is ready for modern CI/CD pipelines and containerization.

### Prerequisites
* GoLang 1.26+ (if building from source)

### Building the Engine
Use the provided build scripts to compile AxonASP for your target architecture:

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
./build.sh --platform "linux" --architecture "amd64"
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\build.ps1 -Platform "windows" -Architecture "amd64"
```

You can optionally disable specific libraries (e.g., `lib_g3crypto_disabled`) to create leaner binaries. See the manual for details.

### Deployment Architecture
Deploy AxonASP via its built-in HTTP server (Reverse Proxy Mode) or via FastCGI (`axonasp-fastcgi`). It integrates flawlessly with Nginx and Apache. 

See our full documentation in `www/manual/md/` for examples and complete API details.
